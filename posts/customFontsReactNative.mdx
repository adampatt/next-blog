excerpt: In this tutorial you will learn how to install and use a custom font in a React-Native project. The final code pattern can be used within any react native component that you require to have a custom font.

## Custom fonts in React-native

### Prerequisites

Expo installed on your local machine. You can learn how to install [here](https://docs.expo.dev/).

A React Native project project open. A guide on how to set-up a project can be found in the [React Native documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

### Installing additional packages

You will begin by installing the expo-font and expo-app-loading packages. These packages are required to render custom fonts in a React Native project.

### expo-font

Expo enables you to load fonts from the web and use them in a react native component. To install the package navigate to the command line within your project and paste the code in below.

```javascript
$ expo install expo-font
```

### expo-app-loading

This package tells your project to display the splash screen while the fonts are being downloaded. It is used to download fonts, logos and other assets that you require for your project. To install the package navigate to the command line within your project and paste the code in below.

```javascript
$ expo install expo-app-loading
```

### Importing the libraries to the component

In the App.js file you will now import the two previously downloaded libraries. These are placed at the top of your file.

```javascript
App.js

import React from "react"
<--> Lines to add below
import * as Font from "expo-font";
import Apploading from "expo-app-loading";
```

### Adding the fonts to the project as an asset

The next step is for you to choose your fonts in this tutorial I am using Poppins from google fonts. You will download the fonts as a folder to your local machine then create a new folder inside your project call assets. I find the best place to create this folder is inside the src. Your folder structure will end up looking like this

```javascript
AppName
| -- public
| -- src
    | -- pages
    | -- assets
        | -- Imported google fonts file
```

### Using the loadAsync method

The next step is to create the loadAsync method inside your App.js file which is how your fonts will be loaded. The naming convention is important to take notice of here as it is how you will reference the font when you want to use it.

Inside your App.js file above your main function enter the code below.

```javascript
App.js;

const getFonts = () =>
  Font.loadAsync({
    Poppins_400Regular: require("../assets/Poppins/Poppins-Regular.ttf"),
  });
```

The function above is importing the Poppins regular font asynchronously from the assets folder.

### Creating state for the font

You will create a local state here to describe if the font have been successfully downloaded or if the page still needs to wait.

Inside your App.js file within your main function enter the code below.

```javascript
App.js;

const [fontAvailable, setFontsAvailable] = useState(false);
```

You will also need to import useState at the top of your file.

```javascript
App.js;

import React, { useState } from "react";
```

These two steps ensure that you can change the state of fontAvailable in the next step

### Using AppLoading

You will set up an if statement that holds the main body of your file here. This uses AppLoading to asynchronously fetch your fonts while the page loads. Once the fonts are loaded it will then display the contents of your page. Inside your App.js file insert the code below.

```javascript
App.js

if (fontLoading === false) {
  return (
      <Apploading
        startAsync={getFonts}
        onFinish={() => {
          setFontsLoading(true);
        }}
        onError={console.warn}
      />
    );
  } else {
    return (
    //You can return your View or any component here
    );
  }
```

This function is saying while fontLoading is not true run the AppLoading function which when it has finished and fetches your fonts sets the state of fontLoading to true. This then triggers the if statement to run again and now returns the body of your file.

### The final App.js

```javascript
App.js;
import React, { useState } from "react";
import * as Font from "expo-font";
import Apploading from "expo-app-loading";

const getFonts = () =>
  Font.loadAsync({
    Poppins_400Regular: require("../assets/Poppins/Poppins-Regular.ttf"),
  });

export default function App() {
  const [fontsLoading, setFontsLoading] = useState(false);

  if (fontsloaded === false) {
    return (
      <Apploading
        startAsync={getFonts}
        onFinish={() => setFontsLoading(true)}
        onError={console.warn}
      />
    );
  } else {
    return (
      <View>
        <Text style={styles.NewFontFamily}>Hello world</Text>
      </View>
    );
  }
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  NewFontFamily: {
    fontFamily: Poppins_400Regular,
  },
});
```
