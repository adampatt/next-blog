## React Portals and how to use them

### What are they?

Portals enable us to render a DOM node outside of the parent DOM hierarchy. I think of them as a component that you can attach to another display it and have all the benefits of a standard component.

### Why would we use them?

They have many use-cases but the most common are

- Modals
- Tooltips
- Loaders

### How do we use them?

The syntax for using a portal is

```javascript
ReactDOM.createPortal(child, container);
```

Here is the [React offical documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html) on Portals for another explanation.

The child is any component that we want to render here. The second argument is a DOM element.

The portal can access context and state exactly the same as the DOM element it is connected to. It behaves in the same way as a normal component.

### Creating a modal

To create this modal we will create four new files and import the Modal component into App.tsx to display it.

- modal.tsx : This will be our actual modal component
- modalFunctions.ts : This will contain the logic and state for the Modal. I find it's best practice to seperate out functions where I can to make testing them easier.
- modal.types.ts : This will contain our modal types
- App.tsx : In here will be a button to display the modal and the modal itself

```Typescript
//Modal.tsx
import React from "react"
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import { IModalProps } from "./modal.types/"


export const Modal = ({ isShown, hide, modalContent,
	headerText}: IModalProps) => {

    const modal = (
        <div>
            <h2>
            Title of the modal outside of the parent component but inside the DOM tree
            </h2>
            <button onClick={hide}>
                Close
            </button>
            <p>{modalContent}</p>
        </div>
    );

    return isShown
        ? ReactDOM.createPortal(modal, document.body)
        : null;
};
```

The bottom three lines of this file is the most important. It uses a ternary operator to decide if the Modal should be shown.

Our Modal types

```Typescript
//modal.types.ts
export interface IModalProps {
	isShown?: boolean;
	hide?: () => void;
	modalContent?: JSX.Element;
	headerText?: string;
}
```

In the functions folder we will create state and a toggle function to display the modal.

```Typescript
//modalFunctions.ts
import { useState } from "react";

export const useModal = () => {
    const [isShown, setIsShown] = useState<boolean>(false);

    const toggle = () => setIsShown(!isShown);

    return {
        isShown,
        toggle,
    };
};
```

Here is our App component where we import the modal and provide a button to toggle if it is displayed.

```Typescript
//App.tsx
import './App.css'
import React, { useState } from "react"
import { Modal } from "./modal"
import { useModal } from "./modalfunctions";


export default function App() {

    const { isShown, toggle} = useModal();

    return (
        <div>
            <button onClick={toggle}>
                Open modal
            </button>
                <Modal
                isShown={isShown}
                hide={toggle}
                modalContent={"This is the modal content"}
                />
        </div>
    )
}
```

### Conclusion

Creating a modal like this means the modal will not inherit the width and size properties of the parent component but will have all the functionality of a normal React component. The most important part of the files is line
